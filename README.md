#  Learnquest Advanced Java

These are the materials I used.
The src directory contains both lab code and code for some of the demos I used. It's all quite basic.
If the class is advanced enough, I do follow up the callbacks with an intro to Java futures, I did a brief demo and discussion.
I'll find the demo and add it to the repo
